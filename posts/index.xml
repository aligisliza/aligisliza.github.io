      <description>Hola, iam Elizabeth Evans, Have a pleasant day.
Are Bigger Ear Tips Better? [Solved] For example, if you have medium sized ear canals, a small ear tip will allow the earphone to fit deeper, which may give a better result. Or, a larger ear tip may sit further out for better comfort, and with the size of your ear or an over-the-ear wear style, still stay put.
